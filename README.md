# Hello-World
My name is <strong>Tobi</strong> Dele-Safa. <br>
I recently graduated from the University of Ibadan <br>
I love  thinking up and creating solutions to problems <br>
I also want to make the world a better place..because <em> why not? </em> <br>
I have four sisters and a loving mother
I hope to learn and apply my knowledge from this program to real life issues.
